    purpose:
      "A grid of cards that respond to the cursor with a radial spotlight and subtle parallax tilt.",
    why: "Pointer-aware surfaces add depth without weight. The same technique highlights focus in dashboards and pricing tables — and degrades to a calm static state on touch.",

    id: "command-palette",
    title: "Command Palette",
    category: "UI Interaction",
    tags: ["keyboard-first", "fuzzy search", "a11y"],
    purpose:
      "A fully keyboard-navigable command surface with fuzzy filtering and an animated active state.",
    why: "Command palettes are how power users move through real products. This rehearses focus management, keyboard navigation, and shared-layout highlighting.",
    featured: true,

    title: "Metric Explorer",
    category: "Data Viz",
    tags: ["interactive model", "animation", "tabular-nums"],
    purpose:
      "Sliders feed a small latency model and animate the resulting distribution in real time.",
    why: "Performance work means making trade-offs legible. Turning inputs into an animated, readable chart is the core of any metrics dashboard.",

    category: "Motion Systems",
    tags: ["orchestration", "replayable", "reduced-motion"],
    purpose:
      "A replayable staggered reveal with adjustable choreography — tight, balanced, or loose.",
    why: "Stagger timing is the difference between motion that feels engineered and motion that feels random. This is the system behind every list and grid reveal on the site.",

    title: "Bento Morph",
    category: "Layout Systems",
    tags: ["shared layout", "FLIP", "responsive"],
    purpose:
      "A bento layout that smoothly re-flows between an overview and a focused arrangement.",
    why: "Layout transitions keep users oriented when a view changes. Shared-layout animation makes a re-arrangement feel like one continuous space.",

    title: "Magnetic Controls",
    category: "Microinteractions",
    tags: ["spring physics", "cursor", "touch-safe"],
    purpose:
      "Controls that lean toward the cursor with spring physics and settle back on release.",
    why: "Microinteractions signal that a surface is alive and responsive. Tuned springs — not linear tweens — are what make it feel physical rather than gimmicky.",

    purpose:
      "A typewriter that types with human cadence — variable speed, punctuation pauses, faster deletes — across rotating phrases.",

    purpose:
      "Draggable elements that spring back to origin with live-tunable stiffness and damping, and gently repel when they overlap.",
    why: "Spring constants are abstract until you feel them. Exposing stiffness and damping as live controls is how you build intuition for the physics behind every polished microinteraction.",

    purpose:
      "A code editor that classifies and colors tokens in real time using a regex tokenizer painted into a mirror overlay — no syntax library.",
    why: "The textarea-overlay mirror is the technique behind every in-browser code editor. Tokenizing by hand rehearses the parsing and DOM-sync discipline that real editors demand.",
